A Leiningen template for calling forth a new kraken-works component project from the
deep.

This is used for microservices that speak [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) (via [Kehaar](https://github.com/democracyworks/kehaar)), use [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com), and deploy to [WildFly](http://wildfly.org).

## Usage

Issue the following summons at the wizard prompt:

```
> lein new kraken-works <name>
```

Follow the TODOs printed out and in the README.md

## Installing locally

> This is only necessary if you're testing local changes.
> Otherwise `lein new kraken-works` will just download the latest version
> from Clojars.

From this directory, run:

```
> lein install
```
